A small master program for Windows

You click buttons (or press their first letter if they are top-left most with that first letter)
And then it either copies their text or opens their program.

You click `this` and it opens the table file so you can add your own stuff.

I just use it for „quotes“ and `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`, honestly...
